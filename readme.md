# Regional Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Strategic Evolution (REVISE) 2.0 Model

The Regional Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Strategic Evolution (REVISE) is a comprehensive optimization framework of multistage planning inter-city corridor public charging infrastructure. The scope of REVISE 2.0 is at the national scale of the entire mainland interstate highways connecting all MSAs in 48 states of the U.S. As shown in the model outline below, the core model is a mixed integer programming model with multiple objectives and is solved using the genetic algorithm coupled with parallel computing. As the model inputs, it takes user-defined inputs on travel demand, vehicle technology assumptions, charging station specifications, traveler characteristics, and highway networks described as graphs (i.e., nodes and links). As the output, the model will determine and evaluate:

  * Where, when  to open charging station?
  * How much capacity (number of plugs) for each station?
  * Who will use the systems, and who will not?
  * What are energy and environmental impacts?
